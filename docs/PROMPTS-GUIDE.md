# SRE Agent Prompts Guide

A curated collection of prompts to use with Azure SRE Agent when demoing the lab. Organized by scenario and intent.

## Getting Started (Healthy Cluster)

Start here when the cluster is healthy to show SRE Agent's baseline capabilities:

| Prompt | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| "Show me the health status of my AKS cluster" | Cluster overview, node status, system pods |
| "Are there any issues in the pets namespace?" | Baseline health check, confirms everything is green |
| "What workloads are running in my cluster?" | Inventory of deployments, replica counts |
| "Show me resource utilization across my pods" | CPU/memory usage, identifies headroom |
| "What changes were made to my cluster recently?" | Audit trail / event history |

## Proactive & Exploratory Prompts

Use these to demo SRE Agent's ability to investigate and report without a specific incident:

| Prompt | Demonstrates |
|--------|-------------|
| "Give me a health report for the pets namespace" | Comprehensive status review |
| "Are there any pods that have restarted in the last hour?" | Proactive monitoring |
| "What's the resource utilization trend for my cluster?" | Capacity planning |
| "Check if any containers are running without resource limits" | Best practice enforcement |
| "Are there any deprecated API versions in my workloads?" | Upgrade readiness |
| "Show me error trends from the last 24 hours" | Log analysis / App Insights |
| "What are the most common exceptions in Application Insights?" | Observability integration |

---

## Remediation Prompts

Show that SRE Agent can take action, not just report:

| Prompt | Action |
|--------|--------|
| "Restart the order-service pods" | Rolling restart |
| "Scale the product-service to 3 replicas" | Scaling |
| "Delete the cpu-stress-test deployment" | Resource cleanup |
| "Remove the deny-order-service network policy" | Policy management |
| "Scale MongoDB back to 1 replica" | Dependency restoration |

> **Note**: Remediation requires the SRE Agent to have write permissions (Contributor + AKS Cluster Admin). See [SRE-AGENT-SETUP.md](SRE-AGENT-SETUP.md) for RBAC configuration.

---

## Scheduled Tasks & Subagents

Demo proactive SRE automation:

| Prompt | What It Sets Up |
|--------|----------------|
| "Check the health of my AKS cluster every hour and alert if anything is unhealthy" | Recurring health check |
| "Monitor pod restarts in the pets namespace and notify me if any pod restarts more than 3 times" | Threshold-based alerting |
| "Run a daily capacity analysis and report if any node is above 80% utilization" | Capacity monitoring |

To set these up in the portal:
1. Go to **Subagent builder** in your SRE Agent resource
2. Click **Create scheduled task**
3. Enter the prompt and set the schedule (e.g., cron: `0 * * * *` for hourly)

### Pre-Configured Subagents

When you run `configure-sre-agent.ps1` (or let `deploy.ps1` call it automatically), these subagents are created:

| Subagent | Purpose | GitHub Required |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **incident-handler** | Investigates alerts using knowledge base runbooks, collects evidence, identifies root cause | No (core) / Yes (full — creates GitHub issues) |
| **cluster-health-monitor** | Proactive health checks across pods, nodes, and resource utilization | No |
| **code-analyzer** | Correlates production errors with source code, creates detailed incident reports | Yes |

#### Using Subagents

After configuration, you can invoke subagents directly:

| Prompt | Subagent | What It Does |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| "Investigate the pod failures in the pets namespace" | incident-handler | Runs the pod-failures runbook, queries logs, reports findings |
| "Run a health check on my cluster" | cluster-health-monitor | Checks all pods, nodes, and services, reports status |
| "Analyze the source code for the root cause of order-service failures" | code-analyzer | Searches GitHub code, correlates with logs, creates an issue |

#### Incident Response Plan

The configuration script creates the enabled `AKS Pod Failure Handler` response
plan. It matches P1/P2 Azure Monitor alerts whose title contains `Pet Store`,
routes them to `incident-handler`, and runs in Review mode. This means:

1. A breakable scenario causes pod crashes
2. Azure Monitor fires an alert
3. The SRE Agent picks up the alert
4. The `incident-handler` subagent runs the relevant runbook automatically
5. Findings and proposed remediation are presented for review before writes

### Knowledge Base

The following runbooks are uploaded to the agent's knowledge base:

| Document | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `aks-pod-failures.md` | OOMKilled, CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, Pending, Probe, Config errors |
| `network-connectivity.md` | Network policy blocks, service selector mismatches, DNS issues |
| `dependency-failures.md` | MongoDB/RabbitMQ outages, cascading failure analysis |
| `resource-exhaustion.md` | CPU contention, memory pressure, scheduling failures, node health |
| `app-architecture.md` | Service map, dependencies, ports, storage, common failure modes |
| `incident-report-template.md` | Structured template for GitHub incident reports |

> **Tip:** You can add custom runbooks to `sre-config/knowledge-base/` and re-run `configure-sre-agent.ps1` to upload them.

### GitHub MCP Integration (Optional)

When you provide a GitHub PAT, the configuration script enables:

- **GitHub MCP connector** — lets the agent search code, read files, and create issues
- **Full incident-handler** — upgraded to create GitHub issues with structured reports
- **code-analyzer subagent** — deep source code root cause analysis

This repository contains the lab infrastructure, Kubernetes manifests, scripts,
and runbooks. Connect `Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo` or your fork when the demo
needs application service-code RCA; the service source is not included here.
Issue creation requires review and stays within the configured repository and
branch. Pull-request writes are prohibited.

To add GitHub integration after initial setup:
```powershell
.\scripts\configure-sre-agent.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroupName "rg-srelab-eastus2" `
    -GitHubPat $env:GITHUB_PAT `
    -GitHubRepo "owner/repo"
```

### Microsoft Learn MCP Integration

The credential-free Microsoft Learn connector is enabled automatically. Verify
it with:

```powershell
.\scripts\verify-sre-agent-configuration.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroupName "rg-srelab-eastus2" `
    -RequireMicrosoftLearnMcp
```

Use this repeatable demonstration prompt:

> Using Microsoft Learn, find the current Azure SRE Agent supported regions and
> cite the documentation you used.

## "What Changed?" Correlation

After applying a break scenario, instead of asking "what's wrong," try asking about changes:

| Prompt | Why It's Interesting |
|--------|---------------------|
| "What changed in my cluster in the last 10 minutes?" | Shows audit/event correlation |
| "Were any deployments modified recently?" | Traces the break to a specific change |
| "Show me the diff between the current and previous deployment of order-service" | Rollback context |

---

## Tips for Effective Prompts

1. **Start vague, get specific** — Open with "something seems wrong" and let SRE Agent discover the issue, then drill down with follow-up questions
2. **Ask for root cause** — "Why?" is more powerful than "show me the status"
3. **Request action** — Don't just diagnose; ask SRE Agent to fix it
4. **Use follow-ups** — SRE Agent maintains context within a conversation, so build on previous answers
5. **Try the "naive user" approach** — Phrase prompts like someone who doesn't know Kubernetes: "my website is broken" is a great starting point
6. **Combine observability** — Ask about logs, metrics, and events together: "Correlate the pod restarts with any CPU or memory spikes"
