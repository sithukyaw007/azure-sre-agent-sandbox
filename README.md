# Azure SRE Agent Demo Lab 🔧

A fully automated Azure environment for demonstrating **Azure SRE Agent** capabilities. Deploy a breakable multi-service application on AKS and let SRE Agent diagnose and fix the issues!

## 🎯 What This Lab Provides

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** with a multi-pod e-commerce demo application
- **10 breakable scenarios** for demonstrating SRE Agent diagnosis
- **Azure SRE Agent** deployed automatically via Bicep for AI-powered diagnostics
- **SRE Agent configuration layer**: Knowledge base runbooks, custom agents, connectors, and scheduled tasks
- **Full observability stack**: Log Analytics, Application Insights, Managed Grafana
- **Working observability views**: Container Insights ingestion verification and an AKS Grafana dashboard
- **Ready-to-use scripts** for deployment and teardown
- **Dev container** for consistent development experience

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with Owner/Contributor access
- Azure region supporting SRE Agent: `East US 2`, `Sweden Central`, or `Australia East`
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) (optional but recommended)

### Deploy

```powershell
# 1. Login to Azure
az login --use-device-code

# 2. Deploy infrastructure (~15-25 minutes)
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -Location eastus2 -Yes
```

The standard deployment includes the Azure Monitor automation profile: four
one-minute log alerts, the default action group, and scheduled SRE Agent health
and audit tasks.

Inspect or explicitly remove the default profile with:

```powershell
.\scripts\manage-azure-monitor-profile.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "rg-srelab-eastus2"
.\scripts\manage-azure-monitor-profile.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "rg-srelab-eastus2" -Cleanup -ConfirmCleanup
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Type `menu` in the terminal to see all available commands including break scenarios, fix commands, and kubectl shortcuts.

## 💥 Breaking Things (The Fun Part!)

Once deployed, you can break the application using shortcut commands:

```bash
# Out of Memory scenario
break-oom

# CrashLoopBackOff
break-crash

# Image Pull failure
break-image

# See all scenarios
menu
```

To restore:
```bash
fix-all
```

## 🤖 Using SRE Agent

After deployment, `deploy.ps1` automatically configures the SRE Agent with:

- **Knowledge base** — Runbooks for each failure category (pod failures, networking, dependencies, resource exhaustion) plus app architecture and incident report templates
- **Custom agents** — `incident-handler` (alert investigation), `cluster-health-monitor` (proactive checks), and optionally `code-analyzer` (GitHub source code RCA)
- **Connectors** — Azure Monitor and Outlook, plus optional GitHub MCP source-code search
- **Scheduled tasks** — daily health, daily RBAC/cost/network audit, and hourly automation-health checks
- **Incident response** — Azure Monitor platform with an enabled Review-mode AKS response plan

### Getting Started

1. **Open the SRE Agent Portal** — the URL is displayed in deployment output, or visit [sre.azure.com](https://sre.azure.com)
2. **Verify configuration** — check Builder > Agent Canvas, Knowledge Files
3. **Break something** — `break-oom`, `break-crash`, etc.
4. **Ask the agent to investigate** — or let the default response plan handle a matching alert
5. **Ask it to diagnose**:
   - "Why are pods crashing in the pets namespace?"
   - "Run a health check on my cluster"
   - "Trace the dependency chain — what broke first?"

### Adding GitHub Integration

To enable source code analysis and automated issue creation:

```powershell
.\scripts\configure-sre-agent.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroupName "rg-srelab-eastus2" `
    -GitHubPat $env:GITHUB_PAT `
    -GitHubRepo "owner/repo" `
    -GitHubBranch "main"
```

This repository provides infrastructure, Kubernetes manifests, automation, and
runbook context. For application service-code RCA, connect the upstream
`Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo` repository or your fork; that source code is not
vendored here. GitHub issue creation remains reviewable and scoped to the
selected repository and branch, and pull-request writes are prohibited.

See [docs/SRE-AGENT-SETUP.md](docs/SRE-AGENT-SETUP.md) for detailed instructions, or [docs/PROMPTS-GUIDE.md](docs/PROMPTS-GUIDE.md) for a full catalog of prompts to try.

## 💰 Cost Estimate

| Configuration | Daily Cost | Monthly Cost |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Default deployment | ~$22-28 | ~$650-850 |
| + SRE Agent | ~$32-38 | ~$950-1,150 |
| **Suspended between demos** | **~$0.60** | **~$18** |

See [docs/COSTS.md](docs/COSTS.md) for detailed breakdown and optimization tips.

### Suspending between demos

Rather than destroying and redeploying, suspend the lab. This preserves the AKS
cluster, the deployed application, PVC data, and all telemetry history, while cutting
cost by roughly 98%.

```powershell
# Wind down (~5 min)
.\scripts\suspend-lab.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "rg-srelab-swedencentral"

# Bring back up (~10 min)
.\scripts\resume-lab.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "rg-srelab-swedencentral"
```

> **macOS / Linux**: these are PowerShell scripts, so invoke them through `pwsh`.
> Running `./scripts/suspend-lab.ps1` from bash or zsh fails with
> `permission denied`, because `.ps1` files are not executable shell scripts.
> Do **not** prefix with `sudo` — it does not help and is not needed.
>
> ```bash
> pwsh ./scripts/suspend-lab.ps1 -ResourceGroupName rg-srelab-swedencentral
> pwsh ./scripts/resume-lab.ps1  -ResourceGroupName rg-srelab-swedencentral
> ```
>
> The same applies to every `.ps1` in `scripts/`.

Both scripts are idempotent and support `-WhatIf`. Preview before committing:

```powershell
.\scripts\suspend-lab.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "rg-srelab-swedencentral" -WhatIf
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
pwsh ./scripts/suspend-lab.ps1 -ResourceGroupName rg-srelab-swedencentral -WhatIf
```

`suspend-lab.ps1` stops the AKS cluster, deletes the SRE Agent and Managed Grafana,
and disables the one-minute alert rules. The agent and Grafana are *deleted* rather
than paused because neither has a pause state that stops billing — per Microsoft's
[SRE Agent billing guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sre-agent/pricing-billing),
always-on flow bills at 4 AAUs per agent-hour and "continues from agent creation until
the agent is **deleted**"; stopping an agent halts only active flow. Both are fully
reproducible from `sre-config/` and Bicep, which `resume-lab.ps1` handles.

Use `-KeepSreAgent`, `-KeepGrafana`, or `-KeepAlerts` to suspend less aggressively.

> **After resuming**: the store front's public IP is reassigned, so re-read it with
> `kubectl get svc store-front -n pets`. Container Insights telemetry takes about
> 5 minutes to repopulate.

For permanent removal, use `destroy.ps1` instead.

### Observability

The deployment verifies recent Container Insights records in Log Analytics and
provisions the `SRE Lab - AKS Overview` dashboard in Managed Grafana. The Grafana
URL is included in deployment output. To remove only the dashboard:

```powershell
.\scripts\configure-grafana.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "rg-srelab-eastus2" -Cleanup -ConfirmCleanup
```

Container Insights uses the current `ContainerLogV2` profile and verifies the
monitoring agent, DCR association, log records, and Kubernetes inventory before
deployment is considered ready.
